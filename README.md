# coma-engine

This code implemetns a REST API developed for Karen Meech's COMA project funded by NASA (citation).
It uses Flask for the web API, Redis Queue for task orchestration and Docker/Docker Compose for virtualization.
The baseline code was forked from mjhea0/flask-redis-queue on GitHub.
It encapsulates SQL query tasks using the COMA database (MariaDB).
It encapsulates low-level astronomy functions implemented in Jan Kleyna's coma-json-server API.
